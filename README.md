## Who I Am

I'm a software developer, a data scientist, a language nerd, and a passionate engineer. After seeing the movie "War Games" as a kid I became obsessed with computers. I spent about a week playing games on my first computer before deciding I wanted to write a game. And from such humble beginnings I forged a lifetime of learning different programming languages, frameworks, platforms, of sharpening my development skills and expanding my understanding of computer science, problem solving and solution design.

## What I Do

I write primarily in Java with Spring and Typescript with Angular, but am more than fluent in other languages (Ruby, Python, Perl, Go, Rust, C, C++), frameworks and technologies. I'm currently enjoying adding to my skills by working on iOS and Android applications using Swift, Kotlin, and Kotlin Multiplatform.

I've worked on platforms ranging from embedded controllers to cell phones to desktops and scalable servers. No single platform or space has ever been enough to keep me satiated.

## What I'm Working On

My current programming goals include enhancing and maintaining the [ComiXed](http://github.com/comixed/comixed) digital comic management system, and getting it's sister project [Variant](http://github.com/comixed/variant) to a point where users can use it to read their library. On the side I'm also working on an idea I've been germinating for a few years now. More on that hopefully soon!
