I'm a software developer, a data scientist, a language nerd, and a passionate engineer.

After seeing the movie "War Games" as a kid I became obsessed with computers. I spent about a week playing games on my first computer before deciding I wanted to write a game. 

I spent years hacking on a Commodore 128 computer, writing a BBS program that never quite got off the ground, figuring out through trial and error how to do tricks like
load BASIC code into a running program so that a program could have an unlimited set of additional features, and figuring out at one point how the World of Britannia in
Ultima IV was encoded on disc, then creating a spot on the map where I could get unlimited food, gold, and other items. Oh, and building bridges between places so I could
walk my characters where we needed to go! I also played around with machine language coding and tinkered with CP/M. The 6510 processor was a lot of fun!

After building my first computer (an x286 with 64kb RAM, a 40mb IDE drive, and an SVGA card and monitor) I started learning how to write code using Pascal, C, and C++. I ran a BBS
and distributed more than a couple of shareware BBS door games, the most popular of which was named [Win Or Die](http://archives.thebbs.org/ra97c.htm),
which I distributed under the pseudonym of "Darryl Basner". A lot of SysOps registered their copies, which helped keep me inspired to write applications.

Eventually I got a job where I was paid to program, and from such humble beginnings I forged a lifetime of learning different programming languages, frameworks, platforms,
of sharpening my development skills and expanding my understanding of computer science, problem solving and solution design.

All in all, I'm just a guy who fell in love with writing code and found a way to make a living doing it.

## My Professional Focus

I work for an international company as the principal engineer for the software that manages the overall operations of each of our restaurants. My passion in joining this company and team is focused on designing and implementing the next generation of software while maintaining and enhancing the current codebase.

## My Open Source Focus

My current programming goals include enhancing and maintaining the [ComiXed](http://github.com/comixed/comixed) digital comic management system, and getting it's sister project [Variant](http://github.com/comixed/variant) to a point where users can use it to read their library. On the side I'm also working on an idea I've been germinating for a few years now. More on that hopefully soon!
