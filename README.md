### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who I Am

I'm a software developer, a data scientist, and a passionate engineer. After seeing the movie "War Games" I became obsessed with computers. I spent about a week playing games before deciding to write a game. And from such humble beginnings I formed a lifetime of learning different programming languages, sharpening my development skills and expanding my understanding of computer science, problem solving and solution design.

## What I Do

I write primarily in Java with Spring and Typescript with Angular, but am more than fluent in other languages (Ruby, Python, Perl, Go, Rust, C, C++), frameworks and technologies. I've worked on platforms ranging from embedded controllers to cell phones to desktops and scalable servers.

I'm owner and chief scientist for Tragically Slick Softare, LTD. We write custom solutions for clients. I work in any space needed, but am currently enjoying developing custom business process solutions for clients.
